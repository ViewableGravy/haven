# World Object Architecture Refactor

## CURRENT STATUS (as of June 15, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED SECTIONS

**Part 1: Chunk-Entity Decoupling** - ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Entities are now placed directly on main stage (`game.entityStage`) instead of as chunk children
- Chunks only handle terrain rendering
- Updated `EntitySyncManager` to place entities on main stage with global coordinates
- Modified chunk system to remove entity management responsibilities
- All entity cleanup is now simplified without chunk dependencies

**Part 2: Enhanced Async Multiplayer System** - ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** 
- Added `sendAsync()` method to multiplayer client with promise-based communication
- Implemented request ID tracking and timeout handling for server responses
- Enhanced NetworkTrait to support async server notifications
- Server now handles async responses with proper `requestId` confirmation

**Part 3: Factory Pattern Implementation** - ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Created `createObjectFactory` utility at `/src/utilities/createObjectFactory.ts`
- Implemented `createLocal`, `createNetworked`, and `castToNetworked` functions
- Global `WorldObjects` registry available at `/src/worldObjects.ts`
- Both assembler and spruce tree factories updated to new pattern

### 🎯 WORKING API

The refactor is **COMPLETE** and the new API is fully functional:

```typescript
// Create local entity (not synced)
const localTree = WorldObjects.spruceTree.createLocal({ x: 100, y: 200, game });

// Create networked entity (async, server confirmed)
const networkedTree = await WorldObjects.spruceTree.createNetworked({ x: 100, y: 200, game });

// Convert local to networked
const converted = await WorldObjects.spruceTree.castToNetworked(localTree, { game });
```

## ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS

I'm looking to do a 3 part refactor.

1. All chunks should purely exist to render the terrain, not as containers for the entities within them. What I mean by this is that worldobjects coming from the server, should be directly added to the main stage with a static position on top of all chunks, rather than as children to chunks. Since the chunk never moves, and the chunking only happens due to the background being expensive to calculate, there is no reason for them to be children. This also significantly simplifies the cleanup process because we do not need to unlike entities from their chunks.

2. (Note: this may be interchangable with 3 depending on which should come first): Move world object networking into a trait that exists on the object. This should be entirely transparent to the consumer of the object, and should automatically ensure that changes to the object (such as moving position, or updating some status) are synced with the server. This does not need to handle entity creation syncing, but should ensure that the state of the entity is synced

3. instead of directly creating `factory functions` that are used, we should instead create the factory function, and then use a utility "createObjectFactory` which accepts the necessary props to do the following:
  1. generate a `createLocal` function, which can be used to create a version of the entity that is not synced with the server - this would be for visual placement of items, or other temporary things that don't affect other clients or the world
  2. generate a `createNetworked` function, which can be used to create an entity globally. For example, this is similar to a mutation in tanstack, as we will use this to essentially make an API request (using our sockets implementation) to tell the server we want to create an object. We then rely on the server responding and the current flow from socket -> world, to add it into the world. This means we can simply "request" the entity is created, and then the server -> client flow will be the way that they are added to the world. (in the future, we can add optimistic updates for this as well)
  3. generate a `castToNetworked`, which is essentially the same as `createNetworked`, but it takes an existing local entity as the initial data, instead of expecting all of the necessary props for creating. This way when we have some local entity, we can just push, instead of deleting and creating a new one. Note: this should probably clean up any reference of the original entity from the game, so that when it is created from the server, there is not two instances.

I need this to be extensible, and treated sort of like you would make a `useMutation` in tanstack, where it accepts the basic "factoryFn" and other necessary things, and the utilities it generates are typed based on our factoryFn

3.1. We are also going to access these factories from a global WorldObjects object. To create this, we simply want a file `worldObjects.ts` that exports an object `export const WorldObjects = {}` and we can import each factory into this file and attach it on the object - do not use the `register` approach, as this could lead to a circular import. We want to import the creator function to built the standard factory functions, and then just import this created object.

I should be able to create a spruce tree something like 
```ts
const spruceTree = WorldObjects.spruceTree.createLocal(opts)
```

or to create it as a networked
```ts
const onClick = async () => {
  await WorldObjects.spruceTree.createNetworked(opts)
}
```

Note: createNetworked should probably be async so we can get a resolved promise once the server has responded. We may need to update the websocket so that we can identify when an event like this is responded to by the server, so we can make a promise on top of the websocket request, something like
```ts
new Promise((res) => {
  ws.send(id, opts);
  ws.on(id, res)
})
```

Obviously this will probably be a bit more abstracted, so that we don't add a new event listener for each promise, but instead rely on the multiplayer client to coordinate resolving our promise when the id comes in. so something more like
```ts
  await multiplayer.sendAsync(message)
  ```

  And then the multiplayer client has this logic internally for tracking events and responses.
