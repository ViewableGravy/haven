## Code Style
- Generally keep components/classes less than 150 lines
- Attempt to utilise single responsibility principle at all times
- use `/***** {{SECTION TITLE}} *****/` for all visually identifiable sections of the code
- Define comments under a `/***** TYPE DEFINITIONS *****/` code heading, below imports and before all other code in the file
