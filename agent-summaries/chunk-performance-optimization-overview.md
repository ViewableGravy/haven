# Chunk Performance Optimization Overview

## Problem Analysis

Frame drops are occurring when crossing chunk boundaries in the game. This analysis identifies potential causes and provides solutions.

## Primary Suspects

### 1. Texture Generation Performance
- **Issue**: `createChunkBackgroundTexture()` creates Graphics objects and generates textures synchronously
- **Impact**: Each chunk requires drawing 256 rectangles (16x16 tiles) and GPU texture generation
- **Blocking**: `renderer.generateTexture()` is synchronous and blocks the main thread

### 2. Garbage Collection Spikes
- **Issue**: Chunk unloading creates many temporary objects that trigger GC
- **Impact**: Graphics objects, textures, and container cleanup causes memory pressure
- **Timing**: GC can occur during chunk boundary crossings

### 3. Synchronous Operations
- **Issue**: All chunk operations happen on the main thread
- **Impact**: Texture generation, chunk creation, and unloading block rendering

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Texture Caching and Reuse ‚≠ê (Most Impact)
**Benefits:**
- Eliminates redundant texture generation
- Reduces GPU memory usage
- Immediate performance improvement

**Implementation:**
- Create `ChunkTextureCache` class
- Generate cache keys from tile patterns
- Implement LRU eviction policy
- Reuse identical textures across chunks

**Complexity:** Medium
**Performance Gain:** High

### Option 2: Asynchronous Texture Generation üéØ (Selected)
**Benefits:**
- Non-blocking texture creation
- Smoother frame rates during chunk loading
- Placeholder system for immediate visual feedback

**Implementation:**
- Use `requestIdleCallback()` or `setTimeout()` for yielding
- Create placeholder sprites during async generation
- Replace placeholders when textures are ready
- Update chunk loading pipeline to be async

**Complexity:** Medium
**Performance Gain:** Medium-High

### Option 3: Optimized Graphics Generation
**Benefits:**
- Reduces draw calls by grouping tiles by color
- More efficient GPU operations
- Lower memory usage during generation

**Implementation:**
- Group tiles by color before drawing
- Single graphics operation per color
- Batch rectangle drawing

**Complexity:** Low
**Performance Gain:** Medium

### Option 4: Gradual Chunk Unloading
**Benefits:**
- Prevents GC spikes
- Spreads destruction across multiple frames
- Maintains stable frame rates

**Implementation:**
- Queue chunks for gradual unloading
- Process small batches per frame
- Use `requestAnimationFrame()` for scheduling

**Complexity:** Low
**Performance Gain:** Medium

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Asynchronous Texture Generation (Option 2)
   - Immediate frame rate improvement
   - Foundation for other optimizations

2. **Phase 2**: Texture Caching (Option 1)
   - Maximum performance gain
   - Builds on async foundation

3. **Phase 3**: Gradual Unloading (Option 4)
   - Eliminates remaining GC spikes
   - Polish for smooth experience

4. **Phase 4**: Graphics Optimization (Option 3)
   - Final performance tuning
   - Maximum efficiency

## Files to Modify

### Primary Changes
- `src/systems/chunkManager/index.ts` - Core chunk management
- `src/utilities/multiplayer/events/load_chunk.ts` - Remote chunk loading
- `src/systems/chunkManager/unloadingManager.ts` - Chunk unloading

### New Files
- `src/systems/chunkManager/textureCache.ts` - Texture caching system
- `src/systems/chunkManager/types.ts` - Type definitions

## Performance Metrics to Track

### Before Optimization
- Frame time during chunk boundary crossing
- Memory usage during chunk operations
- GC frequency and duration

### After Optimization
- Reduced frame drops
- Lower memory pressure
- Smoother gameplay experience

## Testing Strategy

1. **Profiling**: Use browser dev tools to measure frame times
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage patterns
3. **Stress Testing**: Rapid chunk boundary crossings
4. **Visual Validation**: Ensure no visual artifacts during async loading

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Asynchronous texture generation
- Gradual chunk unloading

### Medium Risk
- Texture caching (memory management)
- Graphics optimization (visual changes)

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing
- Rollback plan for each change
- Performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Eliminate frame drops during chunk boundary crossing
- ‚úÖ Maintain visual quality during chunk loading
- ‚úÖ Reduce memory pressure from chunk operations
- ‚úÖ Preserve existing functionality
