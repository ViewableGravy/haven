## Overview - COMPLETED ✅

The `entitySyncRegistry` system has been successfully removed and replaced with the unified `WorldObjects` factory 
system. This legacy registry was duplicating functionality and requiring manual registration of entity creators, 
bypassing the proper trait-based synchronization flow.

All server-to-client entity creation now flows through the `WorldObjects` unified system, which provides proper 
`createNetworked` functionality with automatic NetworkTrait synchronization. This eliminates maintenance overhead 
and ensures consistency across the codebase.

## Files Modified ✅

- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/entitySyncRegistry.ts` - **REMOVED** - Deleted entire file
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/entitySync.ts` - Replaced registry with WorldObjects + async support  
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/manager.ts` - Added async event handler support
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/events/entity_placed.ts` - Made async to support new flow
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/events/entities_list.ts` - Made async to support new flow
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/events/load_chunk.ts` - Made async to support new flow
- `/src/utilities/multiplayer/events/types.ts` - Updated interface to support async handlers
- `/src/objects/assembler/factory.tsx` - Removed registry registration
- `/src/objects/spruceTree/factory.tsx` - Removed registry registration

## Architecture Change ✅

```
BEFORE (Dual System):
WorldObjects.spruceTree.createNetworked() ──┐
                                            ├──► Different paths to same goal
entitySyncRegistry.createEntity() ──────────┘

AFTER (Unified System):
WorldObjects.spruceTree.createNetworked() ──────► Single path for all entity creation
```

## Implementation Details ✅

1. **Registry File Removed** ✅ - Deleted `/src/utilities/multiplayer/entitySyncRegistry.ts`
2. **EntitySync Updated** ✅ - Added `createEntityFromServerData()` method using `WorldObjects[type].createNetworked()`  
3. **Entity Type Mapping** ✅ - Created `ENTITY_TYPE_MAP` for server types to WorldObjects keys
4. **Factory Files Cleaned** ✅ - Removed all `entitySyncRegistry.register()` calls
5. **Async Support Added** ✅ - Made entity creation async with proper error handling
6. **Event Handler Updates** ✅ - Updated all event handlers to support async operations

## Technical Changes Made ✅

- **Entity Creation Flow**: `entitySyncRegistry.createEntity()` → `WorldObjects[type].createNetworked()`
- **Type Mapping**: Added mapping from server entity types (`"spruce-tree"`) to WorldObjects keys (`"spruceTree"`)
- **Async Support**: Made all entity creation and event handling async with proper error handling
- **Position Handling**: Entities now use correct global position from server data via unified factory
- **Trait Management**: All entities now get proper NetworkTrait configuration automatically

## Benefits Achieved ✅

- **Single Source of Truth**: All entity creation flows through WorldObjects
- **Automatic Trait Sync**: Entities get proper NetworkTrait configuration automatically  
- **No Manual Registration**: Factory files don't need separate registry calls
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed 100+ lines of redundant registry code
- **Better Maintainability**: Only one system to update when adding new entity types
- **Proper Error Handling**: Async operations have proper error handling and logging
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type mapping

The migration is complete and the codebase now uses a unified, maintainable approach for all entity creation.
