## High-Level Overview

The power system has been successfully implemented as an efficient graph-based model for simulating power distribution across connected game objects without requiring per-node traversal during simulation ticks. The system uses PowerGraphs to represent connected networks of power providers and consumers, with binary power states determined by comparing total provided power against total required power.

The system supports mechanical and electrical power networks, where entities can be producers, consumers, relays, or batteries. Each PowerGraph maintains aggregated metrics and evaluates power distribution once per simulation tick, making it highly scalable for large networks of connected entities. The implementation includes automatic entity registration, graph management, connection handling, and real-time power state synchronization.

## Usage Instructions

The power system is fully functional and integrated into the game. To test:

1. **Console Testing**: Use `game.createTestPowerNetwork()` in browser console
2. **Entity Placement**: Place power generators and conveyor belts via hotbar
3. **Connection**: Entities auto-connect when placed within 64 pixels
4. **Monitoring**: Hover over entities to see power status in infographics
5. **Debugging**: Use `game.powerManager.logPowerSystemStatus()` for detailed logs

The system automatically handles entity lifecycle, power distribution, graph management, and visual updates. All power calculations occur once per simulation tick with O(1) complexity per consumer entity, making it highly scalable for large power networks.
